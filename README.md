# Replication-Tung-Anh-diss-2022

This file includes Stata and Matlab replication files for the disseration 'Assessing the causes and effects of oil price shocks: Empirical evidence from Vietnam'. 

The main findings of the dissertation can be replicated immediately from Matlab using the file Main.m. I would like to thank Lutz Kilian for his replication codes for 'Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market'.

The .do file inside the Datasets folder replicates the cleaning and generating data process which results in two files VNdata.xls and VNdatasub.xls. 

Further information about the sources of data can be found in the dissertation.
